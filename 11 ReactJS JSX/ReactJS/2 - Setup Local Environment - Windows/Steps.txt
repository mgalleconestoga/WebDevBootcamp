1. Install or make sure Node is up to date
    - nodejs.org and download/find latest stable version (the reboot)
    - > node --version   (compare both)
2. Install or update VSCode
    - code.visualstudio.com
    - Install extension 'Babel JavaScript' (Michael McDermott) - code highlighting
    - Install extension 'vscode-icons' - shows icons nicely beside files 
3. Create React App
    - Follow instructions on React website: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app
    - > npx create-react-app <your-apps-name>         (npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm)

4. Run App / Deploy   
    - > cd my-app
    - > npm start          (starts the development server)    

    - Delete all the extra files and text that are not needed

    When ready to build and deploy 
    - > npm run build      (creates a optimized build of the app in the 'build' folder)
